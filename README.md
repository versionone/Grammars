For Core REST API Developers who understand the basics of constructing queries, 
the VersionOne Grammars provide documentation of the syntax for tokens within 
the query parameters. Unlike the introductory documentation, these Grammars are 
written as comprehensive technical documentation so developers can learn to use 
more sophisticated facets of the API.
